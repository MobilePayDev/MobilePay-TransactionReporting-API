# <a name="overview"/> Overview over Transaction Reporting API

**Important:**
As the reporting evolves, APIs are periodically reorganized, upgraded and improved. When APIs evolve, the old API is deprecated and eventually removed. This means that **Transaction Reporting API v1 and v2 is now deprecated and we no longer onboard any merchants to these versions**. We have instead introduced Reporting v3. Please find the updated documentation [here](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/docs/reporting). We have also made a [migration guide](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/docs/reporting/migrate-from-v1v2) to ease the migration from v1 and v2 to v3. If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact us at developer@mobilepay.dk 

-------------------------------------------

*Purpose:* The main objective is to make it easier for you to do reconciliation on your side. We at MobilePay will provide details of transactions to help you with that, with the products that MobilePay offers. This will be done by summarizing payment, fees and refunds etc. These are summarized in further details below. 


MobilePay TransactionReporting API allows to query all activities taking place at any of your MobilePay payment locations.


Some processes in banking are by nature asynchronous. You can guess and be correct often, but it will cost on support hours for you and your customer.  By integrating and using the API, you take the guesswork out. From an architecture perspective, creating your own mirror database expecting a result is not advisable compared to querying a “single source of truth”. Sales and clearing are two different internal processes. As a merchant, you can sell, but the clearing is not always 100% matched to the sales. This is where the TRX API is highly useful.   

 

# How does it work? 

A settlement pay out includes all your sales transactions from the previous day, net of refunds and fees. By using the API, you get a full list of all sales transactions and corresponding fees, totalling to the settlement on your bank account. You can reconcile your accounts with a high degree of data and transparency, moving your business towards always having up-to-date financial overviews. 
Note: if you chose to have fees invoiced, then the fees will not be deducted directly by MobilePay, and you instead need to reconcile against the invoices you receive. Invoiced fees are not visible in the API.

# Merchant onboarding
This document explains how to make a technical integration to the MobilePay Transaction Reporting product. The intended audience is technical integrators from merchant itself, or from Partner Banks.

As an integrator, you automatically have access to the Transaction Reporting API. As a merchant, you get access to the MobilePay Production environment, where you can test the technical integration. The Reconciliation API consists of GET calls, which is why it not available in the sandbox environment.

The environment is located on [The Developer Portal](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/) 

In order to call our APIs from your systems you might need to whitelist our endpoints:

| Service        | Production  |

| API Gateway  | https://api.mobilepay.dk |

# <a name="authentication"/> Authentication
### OpenID Connect
When the merchant is onboarded, he has a user in MobilePay that is able to manage which products the merchant wishes to use. The OpenID Connect protocol is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

Client: In order for this to work, the merchant must grant consent to an application(Client). Client must initiate the [hybrid flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth) specified in OpenID connect. For Transaction Reporting product the Client must request consent from the merchant using the `transactionreporting` scope. You also need to specify `offline_access` scope, in order to get the refresh token. The authorization server is [located here](https://api.mobilepay.dk/merchant-authentication-openidconnect). If the merchant grants consent, an authorization code is returned which the Client must exchange for an id token, an access token and a refresh token. The refresh token is used to refresh ended sessions without asking for merchant consent again. This means that if the Client receives an answer from the api gateway saying that the access token is invalid, the refresh token is exchanged for a new access token and refresh token. 


### Supported Endpoints
Find the supported endpoints in the links below

| Environment   | OpenID Connect Discovery |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Production | https://api.mobilepay.dk/merchant-authentication-openidconnect/.well-known/openid-configuration |

In order to authenticate to the API, all requests to the API must contain at least three authentication headers:
1. `x-ibm-client-id`
2. `x-ibm-client-secret`
3. `Authorization`

```
$ curl 
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' 
    --header 'x-ibm-client-id: client-id' 
    --header 'x-ibm-client-secret: client-secret' 
    --url https://<mobile-pay-root>/api/merchants/me/resource
```

### Implementing OpenID Connect protocol
Although the protocol is not that complicated, there is no need to implement it yourself! There are many OpenID Connect certified libraries for different platforms, so you just have to chose the one, that suits you best [from this list](http://openid.net/developers/certified/#RPLibs).

# <a name="general_notes"/> General notes


MobilePay Transaction Reporting is a full-fledged HTTPS REST api using JSON as request/response communication media.

All dates and time-stamps use the ISO 8601 format: date format - `YYYY-MM-DD`, date-time format - `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`.

When submitting requests, `Content-Type: application/json` HTTP header must be provided. UTF-8 character encoding should be used.

`$ curl --request GET --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --url https://<mobile-pay-root>/resource`

# <a name="payment_point_id"/> PaymentPointId 

When using the Transaction Reporting API, you will be introduced to the term 'paymentPointId'. paymentPointId - GUID assigned to payment pointAs MobilePay has different API product, and each product has a payment point. The payment point is named differently across products.  

Subscriptions API  

* PaymentPointId = `SubscriptionProviderId`
 
* The individual transactions will contain the same `external_id`, that you have assigned, and that `external_id` will be returned through the API.  `external_id` is the identifier of a specific payment in merchant's system, and can be used for this purpose. You generate this ID. 


Invoice API

 * PaymentPointId = `Invoice Issuer ID` 

*  If you fill out the field `PaymentReference`, then the ID follows, that you’ve written as a  `PaymentReference`, for the payment. If you do not fill out  `PaymentReference`, then it would be the input from the field  `InvoiceNumber`,  that will be the reference on the payment.


### Result paging

Some endpoint queries can return a large number of results. In order to deliver them efficiently over the network, data pagination is used. Query responses which have more than **1000 transactions** are automatically split into pages of 1000 records each.

* A query of 859 transactions would produce a single page
* A query of 1547 transactions would produce 2 pages
* A query of 50000 transactions would produce 50 pages

When data pagination is used `NextPageToken` property is returned inside of request body. You should append the value of this property to query url `pageToken` parameter in order to retrieve the next page. If returned `NextPageToken` property is missing or null then the last page had been reached.

**Important**: NextPageToken value can contain any base64 characters, including `/`, `+` and `=`. Be sure to properly escape the value (By using url encoding) when submitting request for the next page.

#### Paging example

Initial query url is:
`https://api.mobilepay.dk/transaction-reporting/api/merchant/v1/paymentpoints/37b8450b-579b-489d-8698-c7800c65934c/transactions?from=2018-06-13T04:44:06Z&to=2018-06-13T23:00:00Z`

Returned response is:   
   ```javascript
  {
      "merchantId": "123456789",
      "merchantName": "Acme Ltd",
      "paymentPointId" : "08b2f28f-9e5c-4416-ab5a-6338511c8ad1",
      "paymentPointName" : "snack kiosk",
      "receiverAccount" : "DK123456789",
      "transactions": [
          {
              "type": "Payment",
              "amount": 81.00,
              "currencyCode": "EUR",
              "timestamp": "2018-06-13T04:44:06Z",
              "paymentTransactionId" : "AABBCCDD11223344",
              "transferReference" : "00020180624123456789",
              "transferReferenceDate" : "2018-06-24",
              "senderComment" : "This is fun",
              "externalTransactionId": "QWERTY123456798",
              "externalBulkId": "ASDFG987654321",
          },
          ...
      ],
      "nextPageToken": "CiAKGjBpNDd2Nmp2Zml2cXRwYjBpOXA"
  }
   ```
In order to retrieve the next page, you shuould call:
`https://api.mobilepay.dk/transaction-reporting/api/merchant/v1/paymentpoints/37b8450b-579b-489d-8698-c7800c65934c/transactions?from=2018-06-13T04:44:06Z&to=2018-06-13T23:00:00Z&pageToken=CiAKGjBpNDd2Nmp2Zml2cXRwYjBpOXA`

### Error codes

In general the following error codes are possible. Error messages from the API are always in English, and are intended for developers, rather than to be shown to end users.

 * 400 for input validation errors. These will normally give detailed information including the specific parameters which were incorrect and examples of valid values where applicable. It is also returned if the query would yield too many results.
 * 401 is returned when required authentication headers are missing from the request.
 * 403 is returned for two cases: either user is not authorized to access specified resource or user is disabled.
 * 404 is used in the case of trying to query non existing resource. 
 * 408 is returned when request timed out. The request should be resubmmitted later.
 * 412 is used to indicate that resource exists but is not yet ready for use (for long running reports).
 * 500 can happen if something unexpected goes wrong in the API, e.g. an unhandled exception. There is likely to be quite limited error information available in this case and it's best to contact MobilePay, providing details of what request caused the problem and when it was done. One form of 500 error that may be observed is a TimeoutException, which can ocurr when the API server did not receive an expected event after sending a command into the system to be executed. This error should be treated like other unhandled exceptions and reported, rather than ignored like a network timeout might be.

* 404 when payment point does not exist
* 408 is returned when request timed out. The request should be resubmmitted later.
* 415 when Accept header contains unsupported media type
* 500 can happen if something unexpected goes wrong in the API, e.g. an unhandled exception. There is likely to be quite limited error information available in this case and it's best to contact MobilePay, providing details of what request caused the problem and when it was done. One form of 500 error that may be observed is a TimeoutException, which can ocurr when the API server did not receive an expected event after sending a command into the system to be executed. This error should be treated like other unhandled exceptions and reported, rather than ignored like a network timeout might be.
